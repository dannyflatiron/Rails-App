Overview

My Rails-App was created with a focus on deepening my understanding of using Rails and having fun. Perhaps too much fun was had. Nonetheless, the app was designed for fans of the spy genre. There are a few nifty features within the app that I am proud to have built on my own even though the struggle was very challenging. Part of this app's inspiration comes from admiring the trials and tirbulations of hackers in spy movies. This seemingly small interest led me down into several rabbit holes of rainbow tables, understanding SQL injections, etc. By no means is my app of superior quality but its my first Rails app and I love it, I hope you will too. Stay tune for features that will soon be pushed to the master repo such as receiving your encrypted mission details via email ;)

I already built that feature but unfortunately I still lack discipline in knowing when to stop tinkering with things which led me to breaking it oops. I will fix it.

To install this app, follow these steps:

Fork and clone this repository

Run bundle install, rails db:create, rails db:migrate, rails server to open up the browser in your browser, and enter http:localhost:3000.
